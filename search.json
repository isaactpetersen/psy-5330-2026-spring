    "text": "14.1 Lecture\nThe course is primarily lecture. We will meet twice weekly for lectures, at the time and location described above. There is considerable material to cover, and we will move quickly. You should feel free to ask questions during lecture, although some questions may need to be deferred given the need to complete coverage of specific material. Questions and further discussion of class material are always welcome during office hours and via e-mail. Please bear in mind that extensive or complex questions may not be addressable over e-mail.\n\n14.1.1 Lecture Recordings\nMy intention is to record lectures so the lectures are available to you virtually and in person so you have the choice of viewing them how you see fit and so you may review them. Recorded lectures will be posted on the “UICapture” tab in ICON. Unfortunately, the recordings do not capture when I draw on the classroom whiteboard. However, please do not count on recordings being available, in case I accidentally forget to initiate the recording or there is a technical malfunction."

The date, time, and location of the final exam will be announced by the 5th week of class by the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences; the duration of the final exam will be 120 minutes. The exams will be short answer/essay questions. The final exam is non-cumulative; each exam will emphasize information presented for the half of the class that precedes it. However, some integration of information will be required for questions on the second exam. Exam questions can come from lectures or required readings.\n\n14.4.1 Missing Exams\nUniversity regulations require that students be allowed to make up examinations that have been missed due to illness, religious holy days, military service obligations (including service-related medical appointments), or other unavoidable circumstances or University-sponsored activities. Note: the format of the make-up exam may differ from the original exam. If you know that you must be away at the time of an exam for one of these reasons, please contact me in advance whenever possible to schedule a make-up exam."

    "text": "14.5 Paper\nYou will write a final/term paper on a topic pertaining to assessment. The paper can be a literature review pertaining to assessment (with recommendations), or it can be a paper on the development of an assessment technique. The goal is for the paper to be as relevant to your research interests as possible, so it directly advances your research program. Please do not stress about the paper. Your paper should be less than 20 pages (excluding references). It is okay (and encouraged!) for you to use, as your paper, something that you are already working on or to write a paper that you are submitting for another assignment—consider writing a paper that could be a publication. I want to keep the topic requirements of the paper flexible and open-ended so the paper can be as relevant for your research program as possible—the only requirement is that the paper topic is relevant to assessment, and that your paper incorporates ideas we discuss in class.\nYour final paper is due before the last class (Deadline: 9:30 am on Thursday, May 7). Please submit your paper via ICON."
