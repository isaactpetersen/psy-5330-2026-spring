# Prerequisites {#prereqs}

To succeed in the class, it is helpful to have foundational understanding of correlation and multiple regression.

# Description of Course {#description}

Much of the current discussion in psychology surrounding the replication crisis deals with questionable research practices.
However, the field has paid insufficient attention to how lousy/noisy measures might contribute to the replication crisis (Loken & Gelman, 2017).
In this class, we cover content that is relevant to all of Psychology and science more broadly, including how to develop, administer, score, integrate, and interpret measures.
Topics will include, for example, psychometrics ([reliability](#section2) and [validity](#section4)), [prediction](#section8), [structural equation modeling](#section6), [factor analysis](#section20), [signal detection theory](#section9), [item response theory](#section7), [adaptive testing](#section25), [longitudinal/repeated measurement](#section27), and issues in [cognitive](#section29), [social/behavioral](#section26), and [psychophysiological](#section24) assessment. 

In this course, we examine basic psychometrics and the background, development, evaluation, administration, scoring, integration, and interpretation of selected techniques in psychological assessment.
The course applies a scientific perspective to psychological assessment.
*You are urged to reconsider your decision to take this class if you are reluctant to examine these topics in a scientific manner.*

# Learning Objectives {#objectives}

The focus of this class is NOT on application (e.g., how to assess each psychological disorder, how to use particular measures, etc).
This course is focused on important *principles* of psychological assessment.
The goal of the class is to give you lots of "thinking tools" relevant to psychological assessment—i.e., "how to think" about and critically evaluate assessments in psychology—to help you advance your research program.
Learning the important principles will put you in a better position to learn any assessment, and to develop better ones.

# Supplemental Resources {#supplemental}

Even though the course is focused on principles of psychological assessment and not on application, I want you to be able to apply the principles we discuss.
So, I provide lots of additional readings and resources on the assessment of particular disorders, using particular measures, etc.
These supplemental resources are in the "For More Info" folder in [ICON](https://icon.uiowa.edu).
The folder also includes an EndNote file with the course readings.
In addition, I provide a companion book (see [below](#textbook)).

# Companion Book {#textbook}

I want those who are interested to be in the best position to apply the principles we discuss.
Thus, I created a companion book for the course that includes practical data and analysis examples to help you better understand the principles and how to apply them in your own research.
The companion book includes exercises to help you test your comprehension.
<u>The companion book is NOT intended to replace the importance of reading the [required primary source articles](#readings)</u> (which are covered on the exams).
<u>You are NOT required or expected to read the companion book for this class.</u>
The companion book is merely meant to be a helpful supplementary resource for those who are interested.
You can access the companion book here: https://isaactpetersen.github.io/Principles-Psychological-Assessment

# Academic Honesty and Misconduct {#academicHonesty}

All students in CLAS courses are expected to abide by the [CLAS Code of Academic Honesty](https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/academic-fraud-honor-code).
Academic misconduct must be reported to the Graduate College according to Section F of the [Graduate College Manual](https://grad.uiowa.edu/academics/manual/academic-program/section-iv-academic-standing-probation-and-dismissal).
Please note that collaboration with other classmates during exams is not permitted.
However, I do encourage you to collaborate with classmates on readings and to *prepare* for exams (e.g., informal study groups).
Because writing, analytical, and critical thinking skills are part of the learning outcomes of this course, all work submitted by students should be prepared by the student.
Developing strong competencies in these domains will prepare you for a competitive workplace.
Therefore, AI-generated submissions are not permitted and will be treated as plagiarism.

# Course Requirements and Policies {#requirements}

- [Assigned readings](#readings)
- [Class participation](#attendanceParticipation)
- [Midterm Exam](#exams)
- [Final Exam](#exams)
- [Paper](#paper)

## Lecture {#lecture}

The course is primarily lecture.
We will meet twice weekly for lectures, at the time and location described [above](#lectureTime).
There is considerable material to cover, and we will move quickly.
You should feel free to ask questions during lecture, although some questions may need to be deferred given the need to complete coverage of specific material.
<u>Questions and further discussion of class material are always welcome</u> during office hours and via e-mail.
Please bear in mind that extensive or complex questions may not be addressable over e-mail.

### Lecture Recordings {#recordings}

My intention is to record lectures so the lectures are available to you virtually and in person so you have the choice of viewing them how you see fit and so you may review them.
Recorded lectures will be posted on the "UICapture" tab in [ICON](https://icon.uiowa.edu).
Unfortunately, the recordings do not capture when I draw on the classroom whiteboard.
Recordings will be available up to 48 hours after class (for Thursday lectures) or until the Thursday class period (for Tuesday lectures).
However, <u>please do not count on recordings being available</u>, in case I accidentally forget to initiate the recording or there is a technical malfunction.
The availability of lecture recordings will not be extended beyond 48 hours after lecture—the recordings are meant to help people keep up with lectures and for students to retrieve the relevant content if they missed anything during the live lecture or if they miss the lecture; they are not meant to be a study method that allows people to fall behind in class from week to week.
If you miss something and are unable to watch the lecture recording, you can get/review notes with a peer, and then come to office hours if you have specific questions.

## Attendance and Participation {#attendanceParticipation}

Attendance and participation are strongly encouraged to maximize your and others' learning.

## Readings {#readings}

We have lots of content to cover, and the lectures will move quickly.
Thus, doing the relevant readings *before* each class will help you best come prepared to learn the material presented in class.
Readings and other materials will be posted on [ICON](https://icon.uiowa.edu).
The articles to read are specified in the [Articles](#articles) section of the syllabus.

## Examinations {#exams}

There will be 2 exams.
The exams will be short answer/essay questions.
The final exam is non-cumulative; each exam will emphasize information presented for the half of the class that precedes it.
However, some integration of information will be required for questions on the second exam.
Exam questions can come from lectures or required readings.

### Missing Exams {#missingExams}

Students are allowed to make up exams that have been missed due to illness, mandatory religious observations, official University activities, or other unavoidable circumstances.
Note: the format of the make-up exam may differ from the original exam.
If you know that you must be away at the time of an exam for one of these reasons, please contact me in advance whenever possible to schedule a make-up exam.

## Paper {#paper}

You will write a final/term paper on a topic pertaining to assessment.
The paper can be a literature review pertaining to assessment (with recommendations), or it can be a paper on the development of an assessment technique.
The goal is for the paper to be as relevant to your research interests as possible, so it directly advances your research program.
Please do not stress about the paper.
Your paper should be less than 20 pages (excluding references).
It is okay (and encouraged!) for you to use, as your paper, something that you are already working on or to write a paper that you are submitting for another assignment—consider writing a paper that could be a publication.
I want to keep the topic requirements of the paper flexible and open-ended so the paper can be as relevant for your research program as possible—the only requirement is that the paper topic is relevant to assessment, and that your paper incorporates ideas we discuss in class.

Your final paper is due before the last class (<u>**Deadline: 9:30 am on Thursday, May 2**</u>).
Please submit your paper via [ICON](https://icon.uiowa.edu).

# Articles {#articles}

The section covered for each class is described in the [Course Outline](#outline).
The articles to read for each section are specified below.
Articles are posted in the "Files" tab on [ICON](https://icon.uiowa.edu).

\*Designates a paper that you should read, get the basic idea, and remember where to find it if you need further information.
These are typically historical papers, illustrations of specific techniques, or useful references.

References highlighted in yellow are the readings that you should pay closest attention to.
Blue highlights provide additional useful information.

# Grading {#grading}

Final grades will be assigned at the end of the semester on the basis of your total percentage of points earned on examinations and your final paper.
Grades will be assigned on an absolute scale (criterion-referenced grading; see below); course grades will not be curved.
No extra-credit opportunities are available for this course.
Please note: As a matter of fairness to all students, I assign grades based on performance and do not negotiate grades.
Additionally, a penalty of 20% per day will be applied to all assignments turned in late.
Final grades will be assigned based on the following ranges:

| Grade | Percent |
|:------|:--------|
| A+    | 97–100% |
| A     | 93–96   |
| A-    | 90–92   |
| B+    | 87–89   |
| B     | 83–86   |
| B-    | 80–82   |
| C+    | 77–79   |
| C     | 73–76   |
| C-    | 70–72   |
| D+    | 67–69   |
| D     | 63–66   |
| D-    | 60–62   |
| F     | 0–59    |

The relative contribution of each component to your final grade is as follows:

- 30%   Exam 1 (Mid-Term)
- 40%   Exam 2 (Final)
- 30%   Final Paper

# Tentative Course Outline (exam dates fixed) {#outline}

This is a *tentative* course outline.
Changes will be discussed in class.
There are 15 weeks in the semester, and class meets twice per week (30 sections).
We will have one exam during the semester and one final exam during finals week.

# Date and Time of the Final Exam {#finalExam}

The final examination date and time will be announced by the Registrar generally by the fifth week of classes and it will be announced on the course ICON site once it is known.
<u>Do not plan your end of the semester travel plans until the final exam schedule is made public.
It is your responsibility to know the date, time, and place of the final exam.</u>
According to Registrar's final exam policy, students <u>have a maximum of two weeks after the announced final exam schedule</u> to request a change if an exam conflict exists or if a student has more than two exams in one day (see the [policy](https://registrar.uiowa.edu/makeup-final-examination-policies) here).

# How to Study for this Class {#howToStudy}

To study for this class, my suggestions are:

1. Read the [assigned readings](#articles) *before* each class.
We have lots of content to cover, and the lectures will move quickly.
Thus, doing the relevant readings *before* each class will help you best come prepared to learn the material presented in class.
2. Take good notes while doing the [assigned readings](#articles).
After reading each article, leave a few bullet points at the top of the article regarding the key points and take-away messages from the article.
That way, when you go back and review it, the key ideas will refresh your memory and will help you make the relevant connections to the rest of your notes on the article and to the points discussed in lecture.
1. After doing the [assigned readings](#articles) and before class period, review your notes and try to determine what are the key messages intended to conveyed by the collection of readings.
The will set you up to be in the best position to acquire the material covered in lecture.
1. Take good notes in class.
1. If something is unclear about the reading or about a point discussed in lecture, feel free to consult the [companion book](#textbook), to review the [lecture recording](#recordings), or to ask questions during or after class, or in office hours.
Don't struggle in silence!
1. As you prepare for the exam, review the material covered by each article and lecture.
If there is an exam review or example study questions, make sure to review those closely.
The exam review presents some of the key take-away messages from each lecture and thus represents prime material for exam questions.
The example study questions are NOT comprehensive and are NOT necessarily the same questions that will be asked on the exam, but they should give you a sense of the style in which questions may be asked.
If there is a question you do not know the full answer to, that is a clue that you need to study that topic more closely.
1. I strongly encourage you to study with your peers.
Studying with your peers helps give you a sense about the topics where you feel stronger and the topics where you feel weaker (and need to study more).
It helps both peers in the exchange when one peer explains a topic to another.
In addition to helping the listening student learn, peer instruction also helps the explaining student via consolidation of the student's knowledge.
There is a difference between "knowing something" and "knowing it *well*."
Explaining a topic to someone else helps you figure out where your knowledge gaps are and can help you make sure you understand the topic *well*.
Additionally, studying by explaining topics to others aligns more closely with the exam format (short answer/essay), which demands recall rather than mere recognition—recognition alone being typically adequate for multiple-choice exams.
1. Come to office hours if you still have questions!
